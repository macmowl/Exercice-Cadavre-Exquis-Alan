## A non-sense story

1. **I**t's *2:00 AM*, someone loudly knocks on my door. A man in black with sunglasses (damn man, it's still the night) presents itself as a member of the **FBI**. He tells me he is looking to me, un web developer and invites me to follow him. Nope, sorry, Coffee first. He goes to his black car and open the rear door, someone gets out...

Before having my coffee, I was not able to understand what was happening, but they took me by my arms, and pushed me into the car. I only had time to say #HEEELP!
